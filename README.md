# tech.datatype
[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/techascent/tech.datatype/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/techascent/tech.datatype)

* This library has been superceded by [dtype-next](https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next/) in order to provide:
  * Smaller runtime footprint + lower require times.
  * Fewer dependencies.
  * Graal Native support.
  

`tech.datatype` is a Clojure library for efficient N-dimensional numerics across a range of primitive
datatypes and a range of container types.

As examples of what you may do, here are some colorized tensors built from the US NOAA 
HRRR and GFS models.

* Brand new - [datetime support](docs/datetime.md)
* APL-style [game of life](test/tech/v2/apl/game_of_life.clj)


A nice (slightly out of date) post explaining more is 
[here](http://techascent.com/blog/datatype-library.html).


Generalized efficient manipulations of sequences of primitive datatype.
Includes specializations for java arrays, array views (subsection of an array)
and nio buffers.  There are specializations to allow implementations to provide
efficient full typed copy functions when the types can be ascertained.

  Generic operations include:
  1. datatype of this sequence
  2. Writing to, reading from
  3. Construction
  4. Efficient mutable copy into a container.
  5. Sparse buffer support
  6. n-dimensional tensor support
  7. Functional math support



Design documenation is [here](docs).
